# Playwright Integration for 1001 Tracklists - Report

## Implementation Status ‚úÖ

Successfully integrated Playwright for JavaScript rendering in the 1001 Tracklists scraper.

### Changes Made:

1. **Added Playwright Dependency**
   ```bash
   uv add playwright
   uv run playwright install chromium
   ```

2. **Updated TracklistsScraper Class**
   - Added Playwright browser initialization
   - Created `_fetch_with_playwright()` method for JS rendering
   - Modified `fetch_page()` to use Playwright for 1001TL URLs
   - Added proper cleanup in `__del__()` method

3. **Key Features:**
   - Automatic fallback to requests if Playwright fails
   - Browser resource management (single browser instance)
   - Custom viewport and user-agent to avoid detection
   - Flexible wait strategies for dynamic content
   - Caching still works with Playwright-fetched content

## Current Behavior

### What's Working:
- ‚úÖ Playwright successfully launches and navigates to pages
- ‚úÖ JavaScript is being executed (no more "Please enable JavaScript" messages)
- ‚úÖ Pages are loading with proper viewport and user-agent
- ‚úÖ HTML content is being retrieved

### What Needs Attention:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Content extraction is not finding tracks (0 tracks extracted)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Search results are not being parsed correctly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The site may be using additional anti-bot measures

## Technical Details

### Playwright Configuration:
```python
# Browser launch settings
self._browser = self._playwright.chromium.launch(
    headless=True,
    args=['--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled']
)

# Page settings
page = self._browser.new_page(
    viewport={'width': 1920, 'height': 1080},
    user_agent='Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)...'
)

# Navigation strategy
page.goto(url, wait_until='domcontentloaded', timeout=20000)
```

## Possible Issues & Solutions

### 1. CloudFlare Protection
1001 Tracklists might be using CloudFlare or similar protection that detects headless browsers.

**Solutions:**
- Use `playwright-stealth` plugin
- Add more browser fingerprinting evasion
- Use authenticated sessions with cookies

### 2. Dynamic Content Loading
Content might be loaded via AJAX after initial page load.

**Solutions:**
- Wait for specific API calls to complete
- Use `page.wait_for_function()` to detect when content is ready
- Increase wait times for content loading

### 3. Different HTML Structure
The site's HTML structure may have changed since the parsers were written.

**Solutions:**
- Inspect current HTML structure with Playwright's page.content()
- Update selectors in extraction methods
- Use Playwright's built-in selectors instead of BeautifulSoup

## Next Steps Recommendations

### Option 1: Enhanced Playwright Configuration
```python
# Install playwright-stealth
# uv add playwright-stealth

from playwright_stealth import stealth_sync

# Apply stealth to page
stealth_sync(page)
```

### Option 2: Use Playwright's Native Selectors
Instead of using BeautifulSoup, use Playwright's powerful selector engine:

```python
# Direct extraction with Playwright
tracks = page.query_selector_all('[data-trackid]')
for track in tracks:
    track_data = {
        'id': track.get_attribute('data-trackid'),
        'artist': track.query_selector('.artist').inner_text(),
        'title': track.query_selector('.title').inner_text()
    }
```

### Option 3: API Interception
Monitor and intercept API calls made by the site:

```python
# Intercept API responses
def handle_response(response):
    if '/api/tracklist' in response.url:
        data = response.json()
        # Process API data directly

page.on('response', handle_response)
```

## Performance Metrics

- **Page Load Time**: ~3-5 seconds with Playwright
- **Memory Usage**: ~150MB per browser instance
- **Success Rate**: Pages load but content extraction needs work

## Summary

‚úÖ **Playwright Integration**: Successfully integrated and working
‚ö†Ô∏è **Content Extraction**: Needs adjustment for current site structure
üîß **Recommended Action**: Inspect live HTML structure and update parsers

The Playwright integration provides the foundation for JavaScript rendering. The next step is to analyze the actual HTML structure being returned and update the parsing logic accordingly. The site likely uses React or similar framework with data attributes that need specific handling.
