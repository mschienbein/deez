- ‚úÖ **Unlimited context window** through temporal graph structure
- ‚úÖ **3.2x more memory efficient** than traditional RAG
- ‚úÖ **Sub-second query latency** (p95: 300ms)
- ‚úÖ **Bi-temporal data model** for complete version history
- ‚úÖ **Native graph operations** for relationship queries
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic knowledge evolution** vs static snapshots

### Perfect For:

- **ü§ñ Conversational AI Systems** - Maintain context across unlimited turns
- **üìö Technical Documentation** - Track versions and changes over time
- **üéØ Customer Support** - Remember all customer interactions

## üöÄ Quick Start

```python
from graphiti import Graphiti

# Initialize with Neo4j
graphiti = Graphiti(
    uri="bolt://localhost:7687",
    user="neo4j",
    password="password"
)

# Add knowledge
await graphiti.add_episode(
    "John Smith is the CEO of TechCorp and specializes in AI",
    source_id="meeting_001"
)

# Query with temporal awareness
results = await graphiti.search(
    "Who leads TechCorp?",
    num_results=5
)

# Access temporal data
history = await graphiti.get_entity_history("John Smith")
```
