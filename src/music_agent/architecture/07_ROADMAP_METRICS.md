# 📈 Implementation Roadmap & Success Metrics

## 📊 Success Metrics

### How do we measure success?
- [x] Percentage of tracks resolved
- [x] Metadata accuracy
- [x] Processing speed
- [ ] User satisfaction
- [ ] Cost per track
- [x] Other: Purchase link availability

**Success Metrics (Weighted):**
```
High Priority:
- Track resolution rate: 80%+ (downloads or purchase links)
- Metadata completeness: 95%+ (even for unfound tracks)
- Processing speed: <5 sec/track (with parallelization)

Medium Priority:
- Download success rate: 70%+ (when available)
- Quality improvement rate: 50%+ (finding upgrades)
- Purchase link availability: 90%+ (fallback option)

Low Priority:
- API costs (using inexpensive models)
- Storage efficiency
```

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
```
Per Session:
- Tracks processed
- Successful downloads vs purchase links
- Average processing time
- Parallel operations efficiency

Per Sync:
- New tracks added to Rekordbox
- Metadata improvements
- Quality upgrades found
- Conflicts resolved

Overall:
