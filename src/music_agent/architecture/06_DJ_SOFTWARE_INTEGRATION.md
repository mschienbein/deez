# üéÆ DJ Software Integration

## Primary DJ Software
- [x] Rekordbox only
- [ ] Also Traktor
- [ ] Also Serato
- [ ] Virtual DJ
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Version Information:**
```
- Software: Rekordbox
- Version: 7.2.0
- OS: macOS
```

## Export Requirements
- [x] Hot cues must transfer
- [x] Memory cues needed
- [x] Loops important
- [x] Beat grid critical
- [x] Comments/tags
- [x] Other: Color tags, MyTags, Related tracks

**Priority Order:**
```
1. Beat grid/BPM (essential for mixing)
2. Hot cues (performance critical)
3. Memory cues & loops
4. Tags/comments/colors
```

## Library Management
- [ ] Rekordbox is master library
- [ ] Separate tool manages library
- [x] Multiple libraries synced
- [x] Other: Profile-based isolation

**Multi-Profile Architecture:**
```
1. Profile Management
   - Default profile (auto-loads main Rekordbox)
   - Guest/Friend mode (temporary, isolated)
   - Event profiles (gigs, parties)
   
2. Database Structure:
   - Master tables (all tracks, metadata, sources)
   - Profile sub-tables (track selections, playlists)
   - Shared file storage (no duplicates)
   - Profile-specific Rekordbox sync
   
3. File Storage:
   - Single master pool of audio files
   - Profiles reference same files
   - Different profiles can push different subsets to Rekordbox
   - Prevents library contamination
```

1. New tracks ‚Üí Essentia analysis (fast, pre-import)
   - Use EDM-specific profiles ('edma'/'edmm')
   - ~70% accuracy (matches Rekordbox)
2. Store Essentia + platform metadata
3. Import to Rekordbox ‚Üí let it analyze too
4. Compare results, flag major discrepancies
5. Rekordbox is final authority for DJ performance
```

### Key Detection

- [ ] Musical (Am, C#)
- [x] Camelot (1A, 8B)
- [ ] Open Key (1m, 8d)
- [x] All formats stored
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Key Analysis Implementation:**
```
1. Primary: Essentia with EDM profiles
   - 'edma' profile for electronic music
   - ~70% accuracy (matches Rekordbox)
2. Secondary: Beatport metadata (if available)
3. Store all notations, display Camelot
4. Rekordbox final authority after import
```
