## 🎯 Key Decisions Already Made

### Platform Priorities
1. **Downloads**: Soulseek, Deezer, Spotify
2. **Metadata**: Beatport, Discogs
3. **Secondary**: YouTube for playlists

### Architecture Choices
- ✅ OpenAI only (no Bedrock)
- ✅ Use pyrekordbox package
- ✅ PostgreSQL as master database
- ✅ Graphiti for context/relationships
- ✅ Parallel API processing
- ✅ DJ-focused metadata priority

### Quality Strategy
- ✅ Download priority over purchase
- ✅ Keep highest quality versions
- ✅ Manual saves to database
- ✅ Soulseek critical for rare finds

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Review and fill out remaining sections (02-07)
2. Define "solved" criteria for tracks
3. Specify quality thresholds
4. Plan API implementation order
5. Design user workflows

### Technical Tasks
1. Replace rough Rekordbox implementation with pyrekordbox
2. Implement real API integrations (currently all mocked)
3. Set up proper caching with Redis
4. Configure Graphiti for agent intelligence
