# üñ•Ô∏è User Interface & Interaction Design

## 5. **User Interface & Interaction**

#### Interface Type
- [x] CLI-based (current - for testing)
- [ ] Web interface
- [ ] Desktop app (Electron)
- [x] API-only (for chat integration)
- [ ] Multiple interfaces

**Primary Interface Choice:**
```
- Simple CLI for testing and development
- API endpoint for integration with open source chat
- Rich CLI already exists in cli/interface.py
- Long-term: Integrated into chat interface (not built here)
```

#### Search Initiation
- [x] Rekordbox sync triggers searches
- [x] Manual single track search
- [x] Batch CSV/playlist import
- [ ] Watch folder for new files
- [x] API endpoint
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Workflow Preference:**
```
- Primary: Command through chat interface
- Testing: CLI commands
- Automation: Rekordbox sync batch processing
```

#### Processing Mode
- [ ] Single track lookups only
- [ ] Batch processing (entire library)
- [x] Both modes available
- [x] Queue system for large batches

**Batch Processing Needs:**
```
- Maximum batch size: No hard limit (queue based)
- Processing priority: FIFO with priority override
- Progress reporting: Simple progress for CLI, detailed for API
```

#### Export Formats
- [x] Rekordbox XML
- [x] CSV/Excel
- [x] JSON
- [x] Direct database update
- [ ] M3U playlists
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Primary Export Use Case:**
```
- Direct database update (primary)
- JSON for API responses
- Rekordbox XML for library import
```

## üéÆ User Workflows

### Primary Workflow (Chat Interface)
**Future integration with chat:**
```
1. User asks in chat: "Find and upgrade low quality tracks in my library"
2. Agent syncs with Rekordbox database
3. Identifies tracks below quality threshold
4. Searches for better versions
5. Returns results to chat with options
6. User approves upgrades
7. Agent downloads and updates library
```

### Testing Workflow (CLI)
```
1. Run: music-agent search "artist - title"
2. Agent searches all configured platforms
3. Displays results with quality scores
4. User selects version to download
5. Updates database and downloads file
```

### Batch Processing Workflow
```
1. Run: music-agent sync rekordbox
2. Reads entire Rekordbox library
3. Queues all tracks for processing
4. Processes in parallel with rate limits
5. Saves results to database
6. Generates report of upgrades available
```

## üé® Interface Design

### CLI Interface
**Commands Structure:**
```
music-agent search "artist - title"
music-agent sync rekordbox
music-agent batch process playlist.m3u
music-agent export --format rekordbox
music-agent upgrade --quality 320  # Find upgrades
music-agent auth spotify  # Setup auth
```

**Already Implemented:**
```
- Rich CLI with progress bars (cli/interface.py)
- Auth setup commands for each platform
- Demo scripts for testing
```

### API Endpoints (for chat integration)
**Core Endpoints:**
```
POST /search {"query": "artist - title"}
POST /sync {"source": "rekordbox"}
GET /status/{job_id}
GET /track/{id}
POST /download {"track_id": "...", "source": "soulseek"}
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {...},
  "agent_thoughts": "...",
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```
